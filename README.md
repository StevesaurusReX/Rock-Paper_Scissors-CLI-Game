Official Rules of Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) is a zero-sum game, typically played by two people using their hands and no tools. Players make hand shapes, each with a certain degree of power, ultimately leading to an outcome. RPS is popular worldwide, played by children and adults alike, and often used to make decisions where no room for cheating or predicting the other person’s move is allowed.
What are the shapes of Rock Paper Scissors?

ROCK

The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist.

PAPER

The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position.

SCISSORS

This is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape.

The Purpose of Rock Paper Scissors

Apart from being a fun pastime, RPS is also played in situations where a decision needs to be made, similar to flipping a coin, rolling dice, or drawing straws. The game’s simplicity and unpredictability make it a satisfying way to resolve disputes without the possibility of error or conflict.

The Basic Rules of RPS

Despite its underlying complexity, the game’s rules are straightforward. Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:

    Rock wins against scissors.
    Scissors win against paper.
    Paper wins against rock.
